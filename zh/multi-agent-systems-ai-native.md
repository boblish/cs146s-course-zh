# The role of multi agent systems in making software engineers AI-native
03/20/2026
Share:
Generative AI has transformed software development so dramatically that you can spin up entire services in hours, yet understanding what went wrong with those services still demands painstaking work across fragmented tools. From code generation to code review, coding agents handle the build side. But production debugging? That's still manual. Take the following example:
Coding
Production
To write a service: You open an AI-native development environment and ask AI to "Create a payment service that handles retries and timeouts". AI generates implementation with error handling, using context of your code base
When the same service is experiencing high latency: You start with a hypothesis → Check Datadog for metrics → Switch to Loki for logs → Cross-reference deployment history → Correlate timestamps →... And so on
The problem isn't AI's capability; it's how we architect AI systems. Most engineering teams still use AI-powered tools to execute the same workflows faster, not reimagining how software development and production operations should work end-to-end.
At Resolve AI, we've been building multi-agent systems for engineers to work on production systems. We've been advocating that engineering should be AI-native (where engineers primarily interface with autonomous agents to work on production systems), while most gen AI conversations in software engineering were centered on writing AI generated code with copilots and coding assistants.
We recently presented our approach to Stanford's graduate AI program, diving deep into the AI agents and their architectural patterns that enable AI-native engineering workflows.

### What is AI-native engineering? Why is it important?
AI-Native Engineering is where engineers primarily interface with AI to orchestrate their work: be it writing code or working on production systems. AI-native is a significant departure from just “using AI” where engineers are still interfacing with their systems and tools, but using AI to speed up individual steps of the process.
Here is an example workflow to showcase the distinction.
AI-Assisted: You use AI tools to work faster on complex tasks. The workflow remains human-centric: Engineer → Systems and tools → Correlation → Action. Engineers still interface with tools, just using AI to perform individual tasks faster
AI-Native: AI becomes your primary interface for production work. The workflow becomes AI-led: Engineer → Natural Language Request → AI System → Response / Action. Engineers set goals and let AI agents handle the operational work
Take incident response as an example. In AI-assisted workflows, you're still generating hypotheses, deciding which evidence matters, and manually correlating signals across tools. AI helps with data retrieval and analysis, but you're doing the heavy lifting in investigation.
AI-native incident response operates differently: AI agents perform real-time triage of investigation priorities, generate competing hypotheses in parallel, and refine theories through successive iterations based on cross-system evidence. Instead of asking "Can you analyze these logs?" you say "Resolve this checkout failure" and agents coordinate the entire investigation.
This isn't just faster. It changes what problems deserve engineering attention. When AI agents handle log analysis, metric correlation, and deployment timeline reconstruction, engineers operate at a higher-level, focusing on architectural decision-making and system design rather than tactical investigation.
The shift requires persistent AI agents, not just AI tools. While AI models like those from OpenAI or Anthropic can accelerate individual tasks, only stateful agents can maintain investigation context, coordinate across multiple tools, and execute complex tasks across the full incident lifecycle autonomously.

### Why are multi-agent systems essential to make engineering AI-native?
Modern production systems exhibit what academics call "irreducible interdependence": understanding them requires specialized knowledge across domains that cannot be unified into a single coherent model. This is the insight most builders miss: No single AI tool or set of AI models can maintain expert-level knowledge across all these domains while coordinating a real-time investigation.
For example: When API latency spikes 10x during a critical incident, the investigation requires simultaneous specialized agents performing real-time analysis: correlating traces across 50+ microservices, analyzing slow database queries and connection pool exhaustion, checking recent deployments and infrastructure changes, scanning auth logs for security anomalies, evaluating auto-scaling functions against current load patterns, and analyzing support tickets for customer impact with SLA context. Each of these functions requires domain-specific expertise and contextual data that no single system could effectively maintain.
At large-scale, as system complexity increases, individual AI tools lack the adaptability to handle exponential growth in context requirements. This is where multi-agent systems can scale by combining orchestration and individual domain specialization. This matrix provides an overview for engineering leaders. Find the row that matches your current state to understand its limitations:
This framework reveals the technical limitations at each level:
Approach
What it is
Where the approach breaks
Cause for limitation
LLM
Use LLMs (such as ChatGPT) for individual tasks like explanations, analysis, and documentation
Engineers still do majority of the operational workload
Single-pass generation prone to hallucinations, with no feedback loops or real-world integration
LLM + Tools
AI can call functions to fetch data from monitoring systems on command
Cognitive workload of correlation remains on humans
Limited context windows, no persistent state management across tool interactions
Single Agent
AI follows investigation workflows independently
Sequential investigation, gets stuck on wrong hypotheses without validation
Cannot manage diverse reasoning strategies or parallel investigation paths
Multi-Agent
Through multi-agent collaboration, specialized AI agents coordinate parallel investigations and combine their output into a unified diagnosis
Requires investment in coordination protocols
Distributed intelligence needs formal communication schemas and conflict resolution

The progression reveals a fundamental architectural truth: Each level hits a different scalability ceiling. LLMs lack a persistent state. Tool-augmented LLMs can't maintain investigation context across multiple chats. Even with sophisticated prompt engineering, single agents become decision-making bottlenecks as system complexity grows. Only multi-agent systems can break through the sequential reasoning constraint that limits all previous approaches. They enable parallel hypothesis testing while single agents must investigate sequentially, making them fundamentally unsuitable for the temporal demands of production incidents.

### Building multi-agent systems is a hard engineering problem
No off-the-shelf agent framework like LangChain solves this alone. Building production-ready multi-agent systems requires a rare combination of deep domain expertise and AI engineering prowess. Most attempts fail because teams have expertise in one area but not both. Here’s why this dual expertise is needed:
- Domain expertise determines architecture: You can't architect agents without understanding production realities. Only someone who's debugged production at 3 AM in a DevOps or SRE role knows that log patterns and metric anomalies require fundamentally different investigation strategies. When payment failures spike, you need both database expertise and infrastructure expertise to determine the root cause. Decisions like this aren’t AI problems. They're production decisions that shape how you build your multi agent system.
- AI expertise makes agents work together: Once you've decomposed the problem, you hit the hard part of computer science. Context propagation between agents isn't intuition. It is managing directed acyclic graphs of information flow where each agent's output feeds into the next agent's input. Orchestrating parallel agents requires formal coordination protocols to prevent race conditions and deadlocks. The system needs to learn continuously both from interactions and ephemeral failure modes. Get one step wrong in coordinating agents and your system gets progressively worse, not better.
- The intersection creates breakthrough systems: Domain knowledge without AI architecture is just expensive consulting. AI architecture without domain knowledge produces output that investigates the wrong things. The breakthrough happens when you combine both: knowing what database connection pools do under load (domain) with building agents that can coordinate pool health checks with deployment timeline analysis and upstream service validation: all running in parallel without stepping on each other (AI systems).

At Resolve AI, our team includes engineers with over two decades of experience in production systems, founders who co-created OpenTelemetry (one of the most impactful open-source observability projects in the ecosystem) and researchers with deep artificial intelligence expertise who are the minds behind Google DeepResearch and Gemini Agents. This combination lets us build systems that don't just understand that "payment failures are bad" but know to check connection pool metrics and correlate with upstream service degradation. All the while managing complex agent orchestration that prevents circular investigations and maintains coherent narrative threads across parallel execution paths.
