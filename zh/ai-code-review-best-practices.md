- Set up ignore patterns for generated code
- Configure team-specific rules
Train developers
- Introduce teams to AI review capabilities and limitations
- Establish guidelines for interpreting and acting on AI suggestions

<!-- TODO:未译 -->

#### Step 3: Customization and fine tuning
Most AI code review tools allow customization, including:
- Rule sensitivity: Adjust thresholds for different types of issues
- Domain-specific patterns: Define custom rules for your codebase
- Integration depth: Configure how deeply the AI integrates with your workflow
### Best practices for AI code review
#### 1. Establish clear expectations
Define what the AI should and shouldn't review:
- DO: use AI for style consistency, basic logic errors, and security scanning
- DON'T: rely solely on AI for architectural decisions or complex business logic
- DO: establish clear acceptance criteria for automated reviews

<!-- TODO:未译 -->

#### 2. Human-in-the-loop approach
The most effective AI code review implementations maintain human oversight:
- Use AI as a first pass to catch obvious issues
- Have human reviewers validate AI suggestions
- Track which AI suggestions are accepted vs. rejected to improve the system
#### 3. Focus on actionable feedback
Train developers to analyze AI suggestions critically. For example, encourage your team to:
- Prioritize high-impact issues first.
- Understand the reasoning behind suggestions.
- Challenge suggestions that don't make sense in context.
- Document recurring false positives.
Example of evaluating AI feedback:
AI Suggestion
Evaluation
Action
"Replace synchronous file operations with async versions"
Valid performance concern
Accept and implement
"Add null check for parameter"
Unnecessary - checked by TypeScript
Decline with explanation
"Use more descriptive variable name"
Subjective but helpful
Accept and implement
"Restructure entire class hierarchy"
Too broad for automated suggestion
Discuss in team meeting

<!-- TODO:未译 -->

#### 4. Continuous learning
Implement feedback loops to improve both AI and human performance, which could include:
- Tracking which AI suggestions developers accept vs. reject.
- Periodically reviewing false positives and false negatives.
- Updating review configurations based on findings.
- Sharing insights across teams.
#### 5. Security-first mindset
When reviewing AI code suggestions, always prioritize security:
- Verify AI suggestions don't introduce new vulnerabilities
- Be especially cautious with AI-generated code that handles:
- User input
- Authentication
- Database queries
- File operations
- Network requests

<!-- TODO:未译 -->

### 6. Performance optimization
Train the AI review process to identify performance concerns, such as:
- Look for N+1 query patterns
- Check for unnecessary recomputation
- Identify inefficient data structures
- Flag unoptimized resource usage
A human reviewer should then evaluate:
- Is the list comprehension actually more efficient in this case?
- Does it improve readability?
- Is the operation suited for a different data structure altogether?
Graphite Agent automatically identifies performance bottlenecks in your PRs, helping you catch inefficiencies before they reach production. Its contextual analysis understands your entire codebase to provide actionable performance recommendations.
